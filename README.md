## Games Recommendation System based on Time Played

Project for Machine Learning.

For a report on the performance and evaulation of the the recommendation system we built go to report.pdf

For the graphs that were used we in the report we used the jupyter notebook Performance and Comparison to generate them. Note that if you are going to run this notebook the collaborative filters take several minutes to fit and generate the graphs. The matrix factorization methods are significantly faster and only take a few seconds to fit.
